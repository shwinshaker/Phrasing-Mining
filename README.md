* **Problem**: keyword and sentence extraction
* **Idea**
    * Graph-based ranking (PageRank)

    * Seems to capture the most generally used terms under a topic. But imformative terms may not be generally used terms.
    * Adjacency in documents doesn't necessarily mean two terms are mutually important.
